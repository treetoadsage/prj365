# The Project's README!
Hi. This is Project: ichi.

I am debating if I should post this as it's own site apart from GitHub pages. If I were to do so, it'll be up whenever I am able to fund and understand how to publish a site on the internet. I'll update this if I make up my mind.

You can follow [here](https://ichiblog.hashnode.dev/).

I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NotJoeGardner).

Thank you for looking at my project. :)
